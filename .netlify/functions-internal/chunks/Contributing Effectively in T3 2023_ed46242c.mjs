This document provides information to guide every member of Thoth Tech in contributing\neffectively to their various products.\n\n## T3 2023 Calendar\n\nThis trimester is a fast tracked one and comprises of only 6 weeks of intensive work. We advise that\nevery student gets up to speed quickly so they can start making valuable contributions to the\ncompany.\n\n| Sprint   | Start Date      | End Date        |\n| -------- | --------------- | --------------- |\n| Sprint 1 | 6 – Nov - 2023  | 19 - Nov 2023   |\n| Sprint 2 | 20 – Nov - 2023 | 3 – Dec - 2023  |\n| Sprint 3 | 4 – Dec - 2023  | 17 – Dec - 2023 |\n\n![T3 Cakendar](/T3-calendar.png)\n\n## Thoth Tech Products and Mentors\n\nBy the end of week 1, it is expected that everyone has been assigned to a team and has engaged with\nthe product leads and mentors. In any product/team you find yourself ensure that you follow the\nrules and guidelines of the team. Only 3 Thoth Tech products would be worked on this trimester\nbecause of the limited time and manpower. The products and respective mentors are listed below.\n\n1. Ontrack: Daniel Maddern\n2. SplashKit: Olivia McKeon\n3. Company Operations: Amin Abken\n\nFor every product, the mentors would hold at least 2 meetings weekly, and this would also serve as\nthe products weekly meetings were every member of the team converges to discuss the product\nobjective, populate Trello board, assign tasks, and discuss any roadblocks or impediments.\n\n## Contributing and Producing Acceptable Evidence\n\nUseful tips to contributing in your assigned teams\n\n- The outcome of every task assigned to you would be required to be published to your teams GitHub\n  repo. The GitHub link for every product can be found by clicking the product\n  [here](https://main--strong-fairy-c1bde1.netlify.app/products/products/).\n- To ensure you are accurately publishing to GitHub, review the GitHub policy\n  [here](https://main--strong-fairy-c1bde1.netlify.app/policies/github-management-policy/).\n- All documents are written in Markdown.\n- Tasks would be assigned to you via the Trello board.\n- When you raise a Pull request, it would be reviewed by another student after which it would be\n  assigned to your product mentor to approve and merge.\n\n## Providing acceptable evidence\n\nThis trimester every evidence provided must have an associated Pull Request. Some ways to ensure you\ncan produce acceptable evidence are.\n\n1. Any research work should be documented using our Spike template and published to your products\n   GitHub repo. The Spike Pla Template can be found\n   [here](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/blob/main/docs/Templates/SpikePlan-Template.md)\n2. Any solution testing performed (whether successful or not) should be documented using our Spike\n   template. The Spike Outcome Template can be found\n   [here](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/blob/main/docs/Templates/SpikeOutcome-Template.md)\n3. Any change to a product in development or production stage should be pushed to the relevant\n   GitHub repo.\n4. Document all hours in your personal worklog. Every student must complete a minimum of 120 hours\n   to pass the unit.\n";
