The contents of this guide will assist in achieving consistency in micro-level company\noperations across all teams and products.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Storage of documentation](#storage-of-documentation)\n  - [Documentation Website](#documentation-website)\n  - [Documentation Repository](#documentation-repository)\n  - [Microsoft Teams channels](#microsoft-teams-channels)\n    - [File & Folder Naming Conventions](#file--folder-naming-conventions)\n- [Conducting Team Meetings](#conducting-team-meetings)\n  - [Location of Team Meetings](#location-of-team-meetings)\n    - [Scheduling Meetings in Private Channels](#scheduling-meetings-in-private-channels)\n  - [Meeting Recordings](#meeting-recordings)\n\n---\n\n## Storage of Documentation\n\nUndertaking documentation is a key company operations process within Thoth Tech. This includes\ndocumenting:\n\n- Research findings\n- Meeting notes\n- Testing processes and results\n- And much more.\n\nIt is important to ensure that this documentations adheres to the\n[Writing Style Guide](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/processes/documentation/writing-style-guide.md)\nand is stored in the correct location. The next sections outline where to store various\ndocumentation and recommended documentation practices.\n\n### Documentation Website\n\nThe Documentation Website is \"the source of **truth** - the place we go when we want to know\nsomething about a project, product, or team\". The Documentation Website contains high-level\ninformation about the Company and its projects, products, and teams. Also, it contains guidelines\nand process information that is relevant to the whole company.\n\nThe following are examples of information relevant to be added to the Documentation Website:\n\n- Product information, including:\n  - Product overview\n  - Product goals and objectives\n  - Guides for new members getting started\n- Team information, including:\n  - Team members and role titles\n  - Trimester objectives and goals\n- Information relevant to the whole company, including:\n  - Communication guidelines\n  - Contribution guidelines\n  - Best practice policies\n  - Learning resources (for example, how to use Markdown)\n  - Onboarding and Offboarding processes\n  - Company reports, charter, and structure\n  - Leadership information\n  - Data strategies\n  - Quality assurance practices\n\n### Documentation Repository\n\nThe [Documentation Repository](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation) stores any documentation\nwhich is not significant enough to go into the Company Handbook. Although not relevant to the\nHandbook, adding all other documentation to this Documentation Repository is important for\ntransparency and demonstrating team progress. Within this repository, there is a folder for each\nteam (under the relevant product folder) for members to store their non-Handbook documentation.\n\nSpecifically, the Documentation Repository can be used to store:\n\n- Research notes and findings\n- Planning notes\n- Diagrams\n- Meeting notes\n- Collaborative documents\n- Testing processes and results\n\nthat are generated by each team. This centralised location for all such documentation can be used to\nevidence the work performed by individuals, and by the team as a whole.\n\n### Microsoft Teams channels\n\nWhile the most documentation should be stored in the Company Handbook or Documentation Repository,\nMicrosoft Teams channels may also be used to store:\n\n- In-progress collaborative documents (for example, a shared Word doc for collaborating on goals for\n  the trimester)\n- The Team Worklog\n\nOnce collaborative documents have been completed, teams are to convert these documents into Markdown\nand add them to the Documentation Repository.\n\n#### File & Folder Naming Conventions\n\nFor documents within the Microsoft Teams channels, teams are to store them in a folder which follows\nthis naming convention: **Trimester-Year-TeamName** (for example, \"T2-2022-CompanyOperations\"). This\nensures that the documents are stored under a relevant location and assists future trimesterâ€™s teams\nin finding and accessing relevant documentation.\n\nThe name of each file within these folders must be logical and succinctly describe the file contents\n(for example, \"CompanyDocumentation-Team-Worklog\" rather than \"Untitled1\"). This will ensure that,\nat a glance, team members can understand the overall content of each file. Such naming conventions\nwill also assist in locating these documents.\n\n## Conducting Team Meetings\n\nConducting and engaging in regular team meetings (at least weekly) is an important part of team\nengagement, collaboration, and management. These meetings are an opportunity to revisit and discuss\nthe direction and tasks of the team, as well as how members are progressing.\n\nThe next few sections provide guidance on team meeting location and recordings of these meetings.\n\n### Location of Team Meetings\n\nEach team within Thoth Tech is assigned their own private channel within Microsoft Teams to enable\ncommunication and collaboration. **This private channel is also the location where team meetings are\nto be conducted**. Doing so ensures that all team communication activities are conducted within the\nsame location for ease of access and transparency. Further, conducting the team meetings within the\nsame private channel allows company directors to keep track of team engagement and attend meetings\nas necessary.\n\n#### Scheduling Meetings in Private Channels\n\nThe following steps are a guide through the process of setting up a recurring meeting within a\nprivate Microsoft Teams channel. From following this process, a meeting invite is sent to all\nchannel members and the meeting is added to the calendar.\n\n1. In Microsoft Teams, select the three dots/elipsis next to the name of the relevant team channel.\n   The three dots/elipsis appear to the right of the lock icon when the team name is hovered over.\n\n2. Select \"Get email address\" from the drop-down menu.\n\n3. In the resulting window is the channel name followed by the channel's private email address in\n   angle brackets (eg **Name of Channel** <**Channel email address**>). Highlight and copy\n   (right-click, then select \"copy\") only the channel email address contained in the angle brackets.\n\n4. Next, select \"Calendar\" from the left side pane of Teams, and then \"New meeting\" in top\n   right-hand-side of the calendar window.\n\n5. Paste the channel email address into the meeting participants section (the section that says \"Add\n   required attendees\").\n\n   Then, fill in the rest of the appropriate meeting details (including meeting name, date, whether\n   it is recurring, and a brief description), and select \"Save\".\n\n6. And you're done! A meeting invite will be automatically sent to all members of the private\n   channel and the scheduled meeting has been set up.\n\n(Note: this guide has been adapted from the instructions provided in\n[this article](https://scoutsaustraliansw.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041835192-How-to-Schedule-a-meeting-from-within-a-private-Teams-channel))\n\n### Meeting Recordings\n\nMeeting recordings are a highly valuable source of evidence to demonstrate engagement and\ncollaboration by Thoth Tech members. Additionally, recordings of meetings can be accessed by members\nwho were unable to attend. This allows all members to be up-to-date with what has been discussed in\nthe meetings.\n\n**As such, all team meetings must be recorded** using the MS Teams recording function.\n\nIt is recommended that recordings are placed in an appropriately named folder within the \"Files\" tab\nof the team's private channel. This allows relevant team members, leadership members, and company\ndirectors to access the recordings as necessary.\n";
