Attend any help sessions that are scheduled, everyone is working and studying at different times,\n   this is a great opportunity to get in touch with someone for help and share your screen.\n\n3. Look at the Teams channels for recorded videos and sessions, there is a Q and A, videos on\n   Github/VS code/Plugins on general and there are videos in each channel respectively for the tech\n   stack that your product is using.\n\n4. You can reach out on the teams channel, then anyone in the team can reply, this is much better\n   than directly messaging as other people can also gain from your post. Post in the general channel\n   or the product channel as there is always someone who knows how to fix your issue.\n\n5. Reach out to your Team Members - you can see who is in your team, you can reach out directly to\n   any of them.\n\n6. Reach out to your product lead and see if they can help.\n\n7. If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to respective Project\n   leads and/ or Individual Mentor. They are your point of contact for anything you might need as\n   you settle in.\n\n8. Look it up on google/research your problem, this is a standard why for troubleshooting issues,\n   millions of people use things like GitHub and the internet is full of guides and information\n   which is all a search away.\n\nAlso, the welcome pack we provided has lots of videos and suggestions for working within the\ncompany, if you have not read that its important to go through it.\n\nRemember it’s on you to take the initiative and to use all these different means of communicating,\nits not just about being given the answer, but about finding the answer for yourself.\n\n## Support Protocols\n\n1. Ask questions on the forum and wait for a reply.\n2. Make good use of the weekly team meetings to resolve any issues or doubts\n3. Key an eye for help and training session ran by the product leads throughout, these will be\n   posted on the team's channel.\n4. Be polite when asking for assistance.\n5. You can ask for help outside of your local team, Thoth Tech is a company full of great students\n   with varying skillsets.\n6.
