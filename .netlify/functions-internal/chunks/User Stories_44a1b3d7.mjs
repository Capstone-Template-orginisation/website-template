I also\nwant the ability to send a password reset request to users. This will save me time and increase\nsecurity by allowing insecure/exposed passwords to be easily changed.\n\n## Thoth Tech Ontrack deployment to Google Cloud\n\nAs a product owner, I want to have more freedom in OnTrack development of the company&#39;s evolving\nvision separated from the Deakin version.\n\nAs a student/admin, I want to access the OnTrack via the URL from anywhere and should be able to\nperform all actions those are performed by students on Deakin version of track.\n\nAs a product owner, I want separation of roles as available in Deakin version of OnTrack.\n\nAs a product owner, I want an email sent every time there is a successful build sent to production\n\n## Ontrack Pipeline CI/CD\n\nAs a system admin, I want to have OnTrack built and deployed automatically with minimal user\nintervention in the process, so that the latest version is available. All the building processes\nshould be automated so all I must do is initiate the building.\n\nAs a user, I want to access an up-to-date version of OnTrack hosted on GCP (Google Cloud Platform)\nso that I will not have to wait for the service to be manually updated.\n\nAs a developer, I want the pipeline to be as simple and maintainable as possible so that it can\neasily be updated to support future versions of OnTrack. Different versions should be obvious and\nlabelled appropriately.\n\nAs a developer, I want a generic deployment pipeline that can be simply changed out in the future,\nso that deployment targets for different services can be used. This should be done with\nenvironmental variables.\n";
