If that's the case, you'll bump into an error: \"The\nWindows Subsystem for Linux optional component is not enabled. Please enable it and try again.\"\n\nHere's how to enable Windows Subsystem for Linux component in Windows 10:\n\n1. Open Windows 10 Settings app.\n2. Select Apps.\n3. Click Programs and Features under the Related settings section on the right.\n   <!-- ![programs and Features](imgs/programs_and_features.png) -->\n   ![programs and features](/programs_and_features.png)\n4. Under the Programs and Features page, click Turn Windows features on or off on the left panel.\n5. Scroll down and enable Windows Subsystem for Linux. ![Windows Features](/windows_features.png)\n6. Click OK to save your changes.\n7. Hit Restart now to finish the process.\n\n## Install Ubuntu in WSL\n\n```console\nwsl --install -d ubuntu\n```\n\n### **Upgrade version from WSL 1 to WSL 2**\n\nTo see whether your Linux distribution is set to WSL 1 or WSL 2, use the command:\n\n```console\nwsl -l -v\n```\n\nTo change versions, use the command:\n\n```console\nwsl --set-version <distro name> 2\n```\n\nOnce installed, you can either launch the application directly from the store or search for Ubuntu\nin your Windows search bar.\n\n![Search Bar](/search_bar.png)\n\nOnce Ubuntu has finished its initial setup you will need to create a username and password (this\ndoes not need to match your Windows user credentials).\n\n![Sub System](/ubuntu_sub_system.png)\n\nFinally, it’s always good practice to install the latest updates with the following commands,\nentering your password when prompted.\n\n```console\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt upgrade\nsudo apt-get install net-tools (windows/linux installation)\n```\n\n## Enable Docker Support for WSL2\n\n![Docker Support](/dockersupport.png)\n\n1. From the Docker menu, select Settings > General.\n2. Select the Use WSL 2 based engine check box. _If you have installed Docker Desktop on a system\n   that supports WSL 2, this option will be enabled by default._\n3. Click Apply & Restart.\n\n## Converting WSL 1 Operating Systems to WSL 2 on Windows\n\nIf you are using WSL1 You will need Windows 10 build 18917 or higher to be able to use WSL 2. Please\nnote, you will need to have the Powershell Administrator window up. If you are converting WSL 1 to\nWSL 2 I’d assume you have Linux Subsystem for Windows installed. If not, the following command will\ninstall it for you.\n\n```console\nEnable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux\n```\n\nOnce you do that you will need to run:\n\n```console\nEnable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName VirtualMachinePlatform\n```\n\nNow you should be able to run, substitute \"Distro\" with your specific distribution. You can get a\nlist by using the command:\n\n```console\nwsl --list --verbose\nwsl --set-version <Distro> 2\n```\n\nFor setting all future distributions to use WSL 2, you will need to use the following command:\n\n```console\nwsl --set-default-version 2\n```\n\nNow the last step is to verify your changes worked:\n\n```console\nwsl --list --verbose\n```\n\nThen you can now follow the standard step for the git clone and docker compose. For development in\nthe project, run:\n\n```console\ncode .\n```\n";
