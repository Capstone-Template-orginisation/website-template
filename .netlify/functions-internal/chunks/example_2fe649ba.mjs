Unfortunately, a lot of these\nstudents struggle with understanding the requirements they need to fulfil in order to graduate.\n\nWhat electives do you do, have you met prerequisites or other course rules? What exactly will you\nlearn and benefit from a unit? Universities also have problems with putting out course-relevant\ninformation that is easily digestible. Most information in course maps doesn't apply to students\nthat have transferred from other degrees or have an altered path to the original map. The team at\nCourseFlow hopes to mitagate these issues through the CourseFlow platform.\n";
