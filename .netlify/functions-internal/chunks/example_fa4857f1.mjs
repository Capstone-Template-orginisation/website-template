The\nproject is in production not only for its artistic merits, but through its development the team at\nthe Art Gallery hope to showcase and introduce webapp development to newer students earlier in their\nI.T. career.\n\nThis career is still in the early stages of development, so there are always exciting new\nopportunities to take advantage of as the project grows and changes.\n";
