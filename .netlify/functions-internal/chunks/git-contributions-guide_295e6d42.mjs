Comment on the progress and any feedback sought.\n- Continue making changes on your local branch, committing and pushing your changes, until you are\n  satisfied the code is complete, passing all tests and relevant acceptance criteria, and ready for\n  merging\n- Publish your Pull request by changing the status to ready for review\n\nAn example sequence of git commands used in this process is provided in the\n[Git Workflow Summary](#git-workflow-summary).\n\n## Branching Guidelines\n\nNo commits should be made directly to the default branch (usually main/master/develop). Instead,\nbranches should be created off the default branch to encompass any changes.\n\nBranches must have descriptive names, including a reference the task/subtask number the work relates\nto, using the following format:\n\n| Branch naming format                                   | Use                                            |\n| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| `feature/<project_task or subtask number_description>` | New product feature/function                   |\n| `fix/<project_task or subtask number_description>`     | For a fix                                      |\n| `doc/<project_task or subtask number_description>`     | Non-feature-related document additions/changes |\n\nFor an example, let's assume the following hypothetical task breakdown for the Voice Verification\nproject (we might expect these numbers to be reflected in a Trello task cards):\n\nProduct/Epic:\n\n### Voice Verification\n\n_Tasks:_\n\n1. _Voice Registration_\n\n   1.1. _Receive Voice Input_\n\n   1.2. _Store Voice Input_\n\n2. _Voice Matching_\n3. _\\<task\\>_\n\n   3.1 _\\<subtask\\>_\n\nA programmer who is going to commence work on the Voice Verification component subtask 1.2 should\nuse a branch named: _feature/voice-verification-1.2-store-voice-input_\n\nThis would be created and checked out by using the git command:\n\n```shell\ngit checkout -b feature/voice-verification-1.2-store-voice-input\n```\n\n## Commit Guidelines\n\nThoth Tech follows the same Git commit message format as required by the Doubtfire LMS (source\ndoubtfire-lms's\n[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/doubtfire-lms/doubtfire-deploy/blob/development/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format))\nwhich this section predominantly mirrors. This format makes for an easier to read and more useful\ncommit history.\n\n### Message Format\n\nEach commit message consists of a header, a body, and a footer.\n\n```plaintext\n<header>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<body>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<footer>\n```\n\nThe **header** is mandatory and must conform to the Commit Message Header format.\n\nThe **body** is recommended for all commits. When the body is present, it must be at least 20\ncharacters long and conform to the Commit Message Body format.\n\nThe **footer** is optional. The Commit Message Footer format describes the purpose and structure of\nthe footer.\n\nAny line of the commit message should be 100 characters or fewer.\n\n```plaintext\nCommit Message Header\n<type>(<scope>): <short summary>\n  │       │             │\n  │       │             └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.\n  │       │\n  │       └─⫸ Commit Scope (optional): animations|common|style|forms|http|router|service-worker|\n  │                                     upgrade|changelog|dev-infra|docs-infra|migrations|\n  │\n  └─⫸ Commit Type: build|ci|docs|feat|fix|perf|refactor|test\n```\n\nThe `<type>` and `<summary>` fields are mandatory, the (`<scope>`) field is optional.\n\nThe `<type>` must be one of the following:\n\n- **build** : Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp,\n  broccoli, npm)\n- **ci** : Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Circle, BrowserStack,\n  SauceLabs)\n- **docs** : Documentation only changes\n- **feat** : A new feature\n- **fix** : A bug fix\n- **perf** : A code change that improves performance\n- **refactor** : A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\n- **test** : Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\n\nDoubtfire-LMS recommends Chris Beam's post on\n[How to Write Good Commit Messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) to improve your commit\nmessage writing.\n\nUse the imperative mood in your commit subject line\n\nWrite your commits in the imperative mood and not the indicative mood\n\n- \"Fix a bug\" and **not** \"Fix*ed* a bug\"\n- \"Change the behaviour of Y\" and **not** \"_Changed_ the behaviour of Y\"\n- \"Add new API methods\" and **not** \"Sweet new API methods\"\n\nKeep the subject line (top line) concise; keep it **within 50 characters**.\n\nUse the body (lines after the top line) to explain why and what and _not_ how; keep it **within 72\ncharacters**.\n\n### But how can I write new lines if I'm using `git commit -m \"Message\"`?\n\nDon't use the `-m` switch. Use a text editor to write your commit message instead.\n\nIf you are using the command line to write your commits, it is useful to set your git editor to make\nwriting a commit body easier. You can use the following command to set your editor to Visual Studio\nCode, `nano`, `emacs`, `vim`, `atom`.\n\n```shell\ngit config --global core.editor \"code --wait\"\ngit config --global core.editor nano\ngit config --global core.editor emacs\ngit config --global core.editor vim\ngit config --global core.editor \"atom --wait\"\n```\n\n## Code Review Guidelines\n\nYou are strongly encouraged to get your code reviewed by a reviewer as soon as there is any code to\nreview, to get a second opinion on the chosen solution and implementation, and an extra pair of eyes\nlooking for bugs, logic problems, or uncovered edge cases.\n\n### Draft Pull Request\n\nDraft Pull Requests allow a work in progress to receive early feedback. The developer creating the\nPR should, in the description, indicate their progress and any particular aspect they are looking\nfor feedback on. When the PR is ready for final review, the developer should update the description,\nre-request reviews as required and change the status to \"ready to review\".\n\nPull requests (draft and otherwise) are created from the GitHub website. Further information about\ndraft pull requests, how to make them, and how to convert their status to ready for merging can be\nfound on GitHub's\n[Introducing Draft Pull Requests](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/)\nblog.\n\n### Required Approvals\n\nPull requests require **a minimum of two approvals**. The default approach is to choose a reviewer\nfrom your team for the first review. However, the reviewer may be from different team, for example a\ndomain expert in a programming language, quality assurance process, telemetry or documentation.\nDepending on the team size and dynamics, the number of required approvals can be higher or lower.\nThink about the tradeoffs between velocity with quality when deciding on an approval process for\nyour team.\n\nThe required approvals rules can be set via the\n[branch protection rule](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/managing-a-branch-protection-rule).\nAll the leads should have access to change these settings and should ensure this is configured when\ncreating a new GitHub repository. For more information on how to set this up correctly, see this\n[guide](https://github.com/thoth-tech/handbook/blob/main/docs/learning/useful-resources/setup-new-github-repository.md).\n\n## Git Workflow Summary\n\n### Start a new piece of work\n\n1. Synch repo and set up for your new feature branch (remember to use Thoth Tech\n   [branching guidelines](#branching-guidelines) for naming the new branch; we have used the\n   guideline example of _feature/voice-verification-1.2-store-voice-input_ for our workflow\n   illustration):\n\n   ```shell\n   git checkout main\n   git pull main\n   git checkout -b feature/voice-verification-1.2-store-voice-input\n   ```\n\n2. Make changes, commit (using comments format that follows [commit guidelines](#commit-guidelines))\n   and push to origin:\n\n   ```shell\n   git add .\n   git commit\n   git push -u origin feature/voice-verification-1.2-store-voice-input\n   ```\n\n3. Remember to submit a [draft pull request](#draft-pull-request) via GitHub to allow for code\n   review (and mark as ready to submit when ready to merge your changes to main).\n\n### Continue a piece of work\n\n1. If the branch has already been created in the remote repository.\n\n   ```shell\n   git checkout feature/voice-verification-1.2-store-voice-input\n   ```\n\n2. Pull in any new code from the default branch\n\n   ```shell\n   git pull origin main\n   ```\n\n3. Resolve any merge conflicts that may now be revealed.\n\n4. Continue to Step 2 in [Start a new piece of work](#start-a-new-piece-of-work) flow\n\n### Collaborate on an existing branch\n\nIdeally, we should avoid having developers working on the same code. It creates merge conflicts and\nhinders efficiency. If possible, try to break it down into small tasks so developers can work\nindependently. In the worst-case scenario, if there is more than 1 person working on a feature\nbranch:\n\n1. Please make sure you pull changes in the remote branch before starting your work.\n\n   ```shell\n   git pull origin feature/voice-verification-1.2-store-voice-input\n   ```\n\n2. Resolve any merge conflicts that may now be revealed.\n3. Continue to Step 2 in [Start a new piece of work](#start-a-new-piece-of-work) flow\n\n**Please avoid force-push and rebase when working on a shared branch**. It can cause complex and\nhard to resolve merge conflicts as well as undo others' commits accidentally.\n";
