Components Migration\n\n   - There is **168 components** waiting to be migrated, in T3/2022, I hope we can continue the work\n     that we left in previous trimester and assign some simple components for Juniors. Delivery lead\n     should involve continuing the ongoing components, seniors should continue his work from\n     previous trimester.\n\n## Deliverables\n\n---\n\n### Short Term\n\n- Gather information and continue the migration work that left from previous trimester.\n- Develop and deliver at least 5 migrated components.\n- Understand and plan for testing new branch\n- Give Juniors OnTrack ASAP.\n- Improve and fix outdated documents.\n\n**_Long Term:_**\n\n- Give enough passion for junior to involve into the same project next trimester\n- Extent documentation for new member to be able to understand the project quickly.\n\n## **What to do next**\n\n---\n\nIf you are new member into this team, welcome! and we are going to guide you step by step to show\nyou what you sould do next if you are:\n\n**_Junior_**\n\nAs a junior we suggest that you should:\n\n1.
