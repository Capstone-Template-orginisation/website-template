In today’s online environment, there are numerous cyber risks that are associated with\nworking remotely. This guide will detail these risks, as well as some mitigating factors which are\nvital for creating a cyber-secure remote working environment. As such, this guide will assist Thoth\nTech members to become cyber-aware and enforce best cyber security practices in remote environments.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Associated risks](#associated-risks)\n  - [Reduced cyber security protections](#reduced-cyber-security-protections)\n  - [Accessing insecure networks](#accessing-insecure-networks)\n  - [Shared computers](#shared-computers)\n  - [Reduced cyber security resilience](#reduced-cyber-security-resilience)\n- [Mitigation strategies](#mitigation-strategies)\n- [Useful cyber security resources](#useful-cyber-security-resources)\n\n---\n\n## Associated risks\n\nIn most remote working scenarios, Thoth Tech members will be utilising their own personal computers\nand Internet networks for conducting company activities. As such, there are numerous risks\nassociated with remote working.\n\n### Reduced cyber security protections\n\nIn office environments, the devices, systems, and networks used have numerous technologies in place\nto prevent cyber-attacks. This can include installed Antivirus systems, Intrusion\nDetection/Prevention Systems, file encryption systems, and more. In the remote working environment,\nthere are typically not the same protections offered unless the individual puts them in place. This\nrequires awareness and financial means to do so and, hence, remote working scenarios often have\nreduced cyber security protections, resulting in increased cyber risk.\n\n### Accessing insecure networks\n\nIn an office environment, a secure network is provided for employees to utilise to perform their\ncompany operations. For remote working environments, however, there is no standard or uniform\nnetwork for employees to connect to – home or public networks instead being used. Such networks,\nparticularly free public Wi-Fi networks, may have minimal security. As such, the risk of data loss\nor cyber attacks also increase should such insecure networks be accessed.\n\n### Shared computers\n\nConducting work on a computer which is shared between multiple people is an increased risk in remote\nworking. Forgetting to sign out of your user account before someone else accesses the computer puts\nyour stored data and documents at risk. The risks can range from accidental deletion of files to\nmalicious manipulation or stealing of files and data. These risks are further elevated should there\nbe one user account also shared among multiple people on the same computer.\n\n### Reduced cyber security resilience\n\nWorking in a remote environment, particularly working from home, can cause a reduction in cyber\nsecurity resilience. For example, individuals may not be on “high alert” for cyber-attacks as they\nbelieve no one will attempt to target their personal accounts or devices. However, cyber-attacks can\nhappen to anyone at any time, so there is a need for resilience in adhering to recommended practices\nand being on alert. In addition, remote working environments have less guidance on escalation\nprocedures in the case of a cyber-attack. Hence, cyber security resilience is reduced, which again\nincreases the risk of a successful cyber-attack.\n\n## Mitigation strategies\n\nFor Thoth Tech members, there are recommended practices that work to mitigate the cyber risks of\nremote working and strengthen their cyber security posture:\n\n- Perform regular backups of data and information, as this assists in restoring information should a\n  data breach or security event occur.\n\n- Ensure that antivirus is installed on devices and that the licence is active, as this protects\n  against numerous attacks. Some antivirus software also offer file encryption services, which can\n  further reduce risks of cyber-attacks.\n\n- Ensure that all devices and device software are automatically updated when new versions are\n  released, as updates often contain security improvements or patches.\n\n- Follow best password practices for all accounts (including cloud storage and third-party provider\n  accounts).\n\n- Only access secured private Internet connections, as public and unsecured networks can put your\n  devices and information at great risk.\n\n- Always sign out of accounts on shared devices before leaving the device (even temporarily) to\n  prevent accidental or deliberate data manipulation or deletion.\n\n- Engage in activities to raise your own cyber security awareness, such as reading relevant news\n  articles or engaging in research to learn more about cyber-attacks. This will improve cyber\n  security resilience.\n\nThese mitigation strategies work to protect not only the data related to company contributions, but\nalso personal and private data of individuals. Hence, it is important to adapt these strategies to\nreduce the risk of cyber-attack, especially as cyber-threats continue to grow and evolve.\n\n## Useful cyber security resources\n\nThe Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) is a government-backed organisation which aims to\nimprove the cyber security posture of the nation. The [ACSC website](https://www.cyber.gov.au/)\ncontains up-to-date information on the latest cyber-threats and a wealth of relevant information\nregarding identifying, mitigating, and reporting cyber-attacks. Some of its key resources are:\n\n- The numerous [learning resources](https://www.cyber.gov.au/learn) which assist in improving cyber\n  awareness and provide information on how to best protect against cyber-attacks.\n\n- An educational\n  [quiz](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/campaign/know-how-spot-phishing-scam-messages/scam-messages/quiz)\n  which tests and strengthens your ability to identify scam (phishing) emails. The quiz provides\n  insightful information on why messages or emails are scams or legitimate, using relevant examples.\n\n- The\n  [ACSC Cyber Security Reports](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/reports-and-statistics),\n  which assist in developing understandings of Australia’s current cyber-threat environment,\n  especially so regarding the annual reports.\n";
