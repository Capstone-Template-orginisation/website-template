For remote working environments, however, there is no standard or uniform\nnetwork for employees to connect to – home or public networks instead being used.

As such, the risk of data loss\nor cyber attacks also increase should such insecure networks be accessed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"shared-computers\">Shared computers</h3>\n<p>Conducting work on a computer which is shared between multiple people is an increased risk in remote\nworking. Forgetting to sign out of your user account before someone else accesses the computer puts\nyour stored data and documents at risk.

For example, individuals may not be on “high alert” for cyber-attacks as they\nbelieve no one will attempt to target their personal accounts or devices. However, cyber-attacks can\nhappen to anyone at any time, so there is a need for resilience in adhering to recommended practices\nand being on alert. In addition, remote working environments have less guidance on escalation\nprocedures in the case of a cyber-attack. Hence, cyber security resilience is reduced, which again\nincreases the risk of a successful cyber-attack.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mitigation-strategies\">Mitigation strategies</h2>\n<p>For Thoth Tech members, there are recommended practices that work to mitigate the cyber risks of\nremote working and strengthen their cyber security posture:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Perform regular backups of data and information, as this assists in restoring information should a\ndata breach or security event occur.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ensure that antivirus is installed on devices and that the licence is active, as this protects\nagainst numerous attacks. Some antivirus software also offer file encryption services, which can\nfurther reduce risks of cyber-attacks.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ensure that all devices and device software are automatically updated when new versions are\nreleased, as updates often contain security improvements or patches.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Follow best password practices for all accounts (including cloud storage and third-party provider\naccounts).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Only access secured private Internet connections, as public and unsecured networks can put your\ndevices and information at great risk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Always sign out of accounts on shared devices before leaving the device (even temporarily) to\nprevent accidental or deliberate data manipulation or deletion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Engage in activities to raise your own cyber security awareness, such as reading relevant news\narticles or engaging in research to learn more about cyber-attacks. This will improve cyber\nsecurity resilience.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These mitigation strategies work to protect not only the data related to company contributions, but\nalso personal and private data of individuals.
