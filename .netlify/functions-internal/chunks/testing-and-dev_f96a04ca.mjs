A simple Markdown\n<a href=\"templates/test-plan-template.md\">Test Plan Template</a> has been provided.</p>\n<h3 id=\"test-strategy\">Test Strategy</h3>\n<p>You need to consider <em>how</em> you are going to test your scenarios as part of this process –\nconsidering matters such as what <a href=\"#testing-tools\">testing tools</a> you will use, what platforms tests\nwill be performed on, any release processes, and what deliverables will you need to produce.

If your software coding has begun in advance of\ntesting considerations, then you should still formulate a Testing Strategy, including a Test Plan,\nto verify that your code successfully meets requirements.</p>\n<h3 id=\"testing-tools\">Testing Tools</h3>\n<p>Using testing tools makes tests easier to write and easier for future developers to understand. They\nadd consistency and repeatability to the testing process, and make test design and documentation\nsimpler.</p>\n<p>Testing tools include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://jasmine.github.io\">Jasmine</a> (for javascript unit testing)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cypress.io/\">Cypress</a> (javascript end-to-end testing)</li>\n<li>Minitest (for Rails)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/tree/v2.x\">Catch2</a> (for C/C++)</li>\n<li>Junit (for Java)</li>\n<li>Nunit (for .Net languages, such as C#, F#, Visual Basic)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html\">Karma</a> (a testing tool for automation that\nutilises other testing frameworks)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But there are many more.

This assists to confirm code\nis actually fulfilling the requirements while improving the robustness of testing and paving the way\nfor automation in deployment pipelines.</p>\n<p>How does it work?</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#determining-appropriate-tests\">Determine appropriate tests</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#writing-a-failing-test-case\">Write a failing test case</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#writing-code-to-pass-your-test\">Write code to pass the test</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#refactoring-code\">Refactor code</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"determining-appropriate-tests\">Determining appropriate tests</h3>\n<p>Tests should come from your <em>requirements</em> and <em>acceptance criteria</em>; they are designed to test\nrequirements not methods.</p>\n<p>From these, project teams solidify scenarios that relate to project requirements – make sure you\ncollaborate and obtain feedback on these scenarios to check that you have understood the\nrequirements correctly. This can be done through group brainstorming sessions (especially valuable\nin initial stages) and through returning to the team for feedback.</p>\n<p>Remember, test-driven development does lend itself to an iterative software development process,\nsuch as Agile, so it is quite suited to a development process where coders start with basic\nfunctionality that may be added to or improved in subsequent iterations. This is okay – you will\nprogress and build, and using the TDD approach allows for evolving such code in a robust manner. A\nuseful approach is to begin with base functionality and increase complexity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"writing-a-failing-test-case\">Writing a failing test case</h3>\n<p><em>Why are we writing a test to fail?</em></p>\n<p>Having determined our test case from our acceptance criteria, we begin by writing some code that\nwill fail our test. Why? Because we want to make sure that our test works; we don’t want later\nchecks to be useless because we wrote our test incorrectly and are having false positives returned.</p>\n<h3 id=\"writing-code-to-pass-your-test\">Writing code to pass your test</h3>\n<p>Once you’ve confirmed your test “works” by failing for code that doesn’t pass your test, you can now\nwrite code to pass your test. This can also be an iterative process – first, starting with arbitrary\nvalues that you know will give the “expected” result (faking it to pass), before refining to be more\nbroadly applicable to how your code needs to work in the live system.</p>\n<p>When you are satisfied that your code is complete, it is wise to challenge your test again with\nknown failing code to reaffirm your testing is still functioning as expected.</p>\n<p><strong>What next?</strong></p>\n<p>Once your code is passing your test, it’s time to examine <em>code quality</em>. Is your code:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>reusable:\n<ul>\n<li>are there components that are (or will be) repeated elsewhere?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>efficient:\n<ul>\n<li>is your code cost-effective and easily modifiable?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>readable:\n<ul>\n<li>could a third-party looking at your code easily understand what is going on?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are concerns which may be addressed through <em>code refactoring</em>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"refactoring-code\">Refactoring Code</h3>\n<p>Refactoring involves changing the <em>internal</em> structure to make it more easily understood, effective\nand/or cheaper to modify without changing the <em>external behaviour</em> of the code.</p>\n<p>While writing a failing test case and then coding it to pass focuses on <strong>requirements</strong> (and adding\n<strong>new functionality</strong> ), refactoring focuses on <strong>improving design</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>My code is complete and passing tests; is it time to refactor?</strong></p>\n<p>You don’t need to assess your code for refactoring on every test, but if your find your code is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>repeating itself (or repeating functionality),</li>\n<li>confusing to follow, or</li>\n<li>you are getting stuck,</li>\n</ul>\n<p>these are good signs that it might be time to refactor.</p>\n<p><strong>How do I refactor?</strong></p>\n<p>Extract function refactoring is one common and intuitive approach to refactoring code: this involves\ncomparing the code intention with the implementation. If the code is doing more than the intention,\nparticularly if it is doing things that may be repeated elsewhere, it probably contains functions\nthat should be split off.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://refactoring.com/\">Refactoring.com</a> provides useful reading that covers a number of\nrefactoring techniques.</p>\n<h3 id=\"further-information-about-test-driven-development\">Further information about Test Driven Development</h3>\n<p>Deakin students have free access to LinkedIn Learning courses.</p>\n<p>A useful course on these general concepts is\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-test-driven-development-3\">Programming Foundations Test Driven Development</a></p>\n<p>Developers working with C++ may also find\n<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/learning/test-driven-development-in-c-plus-plus\">Test Driven Development in C++</a>\nuseful</p>\n<h2 id=\"testing-templates\">Testing Templates</h2>\n<p>Several Markdown testing templates are available:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"templates/test-strategy-template.md\">Sample Test Strategy</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"templates/test-plan-template.md\">Test Plan Template</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"templates/bug-report-template.md\">Bug Report Template</a></li>\n</ul>";

They\nadd consistency and repeatability to the testing process, and make test design and documentation\nsimpler.\n\nTesting tools include:\n\n- [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io) (for javascript unit testing)\n- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) (javascript end-to-end testing)\n- Minitest (for Rails)\n- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/tree/v2.x) (for C/C++)\n- Junit (for Java)\n- Nunit (for .Net languages, such as C#, F#, Visual Basic)\n- [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) (a testing tool for automation that\n  utilises other testing frameworks)\n\nBut there are many more. Look for what is currently available and popular in your language.\nCurrently, proposals have been put forward for utilising [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io) and\n[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) for relevant unit testing and automation\nand [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing in the OnTrack space.\n\n## How do I prove my code does what it's supposed to do? <!-- omit in toc -->\n\n## Test Driven Development\n\nBy utilising _test driven development (TDD)_, software requirements are embedded into the testing\nand coding process, so that functionality is validated as it is coded. This assists to confirm code\nis actually fulfilling the requirements while improving the robustness of testing and paving the way\nfor automation in deployment pipelines.\n\nHow does it work?\n\n1. [Determine appropriate tests](#determining-appropriate-tests)\n2. [Write a failing test case](#writing-a-failing-test-case)\n3. [Write code to pass the test](#writing-code-to-pass-your-test)\n4. [Refactor code](#refactoring-code)\n\n### Determining appropriate tests\n\nTests should come from your _requirements_ and _acceptance criteria_; they are designed to test\nrequirements not methods.\n\nFrom these, project teams solidify scenarios that relate to project requirements – make sure you\ncollaborate and obtain feedback on these scenarios to check that you have understood the\nrequirements correctly. This can be done through group brainstorming sessions (especially valuable\nin initial stages) and through returning to the team for feedback.\n\nRemember, test-driven development does lend itself to an iterative software development process,\nsuch as Agile, so it is quite suited to a development process where coders start with basic\nfunctionality that may be added to or improved in subsequent iterations. This is okay – you will\nprogress and build, and using the TDD approach allows for evolving such code in a robust manner. A\nuseful approach is to begin with base functionality and increase complexity.\n\n### Writing a failing test case\n\n_Why are we writing a test to fail?_\n\nHaving determined our test case from our acceptance criteria, we begin by writing some code that\nwill fail our test. Why? Because we want to make sure that our test works; we don't want later\nchecks to be useless because we wrote our test incorrectly and are having false positives returned.\n\n### Writing code to pass your test\n\nOnce you've confirmed your test \"works\" by failing for code that doesn't pass your test, you can now\nwrite code to pass your test. This can also be an iterative process – first, starting with arbitrary\nvalues that you know will give the \"expected\" result (faking it to pass), before refining to be more\nbroadly applicable to how your code needs to work in the live system.\n\nWhen you are satisfied that your code is complete, it is wise to challenge your test again with\nknown failing code to reaffirm your testing is still functioning as expected.\n\n**What next?**\n\nOnce your code is passing your test, it's time to examine _code quality_. Is your code:\n\n- reusable:\n  - are there components that are (or will be) repeated elsewhere?\n- efficient:\n  - is your code cost-effective and easily modifiable?\n- readable:\n  - could a third-party looking at your code easily understand what is going on?\n\nThese are concerns which may be addressed through _code refactoring_.\n\n### Refactoring Code\n\nRefactoring involves changing the _internal_ structure to make it more easily understood, effective\nand/or cheaper to modify without changing the _external behaviour_ of the code.\n\nWhile writing a failing test case and then coding it to pass focuses on **requirements** (and adding\n**new functionality** ), refactoring focuses on **improving design**.\n\n**My code is complete and passing tests; is it time to refactor?**\n\nYou don't need to assess your code for refactoring on every test, but if your find your code is:\n\n- repeating itself (or repeating functionality),\n- confusing to follow, or\n- you are getting stuck,\n\nthese are good signs that it might be time to refactor.\n\n**How do I refactor?**\n\nExtract function refactoring is one common and intuitive approach to refactoring code: this involves\ncomparing the code intention with the implementation. If the code is doing more than the intention,\nparticularly if it is doing things that may be repeated elsewhere, it probably contains functions\nthat should be split off.\n\n[Refactoring.com](http://refactoring.com/) provides useful reading that covers a number of\nrefactoring techniques.\n\n### Further information about Test Driven Development\n\nDeakin students have free access to LinkedIn Learning courses.\n\nA useful course on these general concepts is\n[Programming Foundations Test Driven Development](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/programming-foundations-test-driven-development-3)\n\nDevelopers working with C++ may also find\n[Test Driven Development in C++](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/test-driven-development-in-c-plus-plus)\nuseful\n\n## Testing Templates\n\nSeveral Markdown testing templates are available:\n\n- [Sample Test Strategy](templates/test-strategy-template.md)\n- [Test Plan Template](templates/test-plan-template.md)\n- [Bug Report Template](templates/bug-report-template.md)\n";
