All content should relate to the heading or provide links to\nother information sources.\n\nArticle headings should not be in a question format.\n\nUse h1 (#) for article headings.\n\n### Subheadings\n\nSubheadings are used to highlight a specific paragraph or area of content. All content should apply\nto this specific subheading.\n\nAvoid multi-tiered subheadings, use a maximum of three layers as a guide. If you need more than\nthree layers, consider creating a separate article.\n\nSubheadings can be in a question format where appropriate.\n\nUse h2 (##) or h3 (###) for subheadings. Choice depends on the layer.\n\n### Notes\n\nInformation that is outside the scope of the content should be placed as a note if it necessary for\nthe reader to understand.\n\nContent within a note should be separate from the main content, short, and to the point. A link to\nmore information can be provided within the note section\n\n### Hyperlinks\n\nConsider using hyperlinks (links) to ensure all information is relevant only to the article at hand.\n\nWhen an article references information that is out of scope, the reader can be linked to other\ninformation sources.\n\nFor example:\n\n> One reference for Australian spelling is the\n> [Macquarie Dictionary](https://www.macquariedictionary.com.au/).\n\n### Lists\n\nThe sentence leading into a list should end in a colon (:). If each item in the list is a full\nsentence, capitalise the first letter and end each item with a full stop. Otherwise, if the items\nare fragments of a sentence, each item should start in lowercase. Use a full stop at the end of the\nlast item.\n\n#### Unordered/bullet list\n\nAn unordered list should be used when the order of the items is not important.\n\nTo create an unordered list, you should:\n\n- end the leading sentence with a colon\n- end each item with no punctuation mark\n- not use a capital letter or full stop if the list items are not full sentences\n- end the last item with a full stop.\n\nTo create unordered list items in markdown, use a dash (-).\n\n#### Ordered/numbered list\n\nAn ordered list should be used when the order of the items is important, for example, step-by-step\ninstructions.\n\nFollow these steps to create an ordered list:\n\n1. You should always use a colon at the end of the leading sentence.\n2. Please put list items in the right order.\n3. Check that items which are full sentences have capital letters and full stops.\n\nTo create an ordered list in markdown, use a number followed by a full stop (1.).\n\n### Text formatting\n\nItalics is reserved for titles and legislations, or user input.\n\nBold is used for emphasis.\n\nFont and text size will be relative to the html due to the nature of markdown.\n\n### Numbers\n\nUse words for one to nine and numerals for 10 and over\n\nFor numbers over 999, use a comma for clarity\n\n> 25,000 or 3,000,000\n\nUnless the number is paired with a symbol\n\n> 3 cm or 2.75\n\nFor complex numbers, use a combination\n\n> 2.5 million $57,800\n\n### Sentences\n\nThe purpose of a sentence is to deliver a single message. The average sentence will have a length of\n15-20 words Thoth Tech has a maximum length of 25 words.\n\nA variety of sentence lengths will engage your reader.\n\nPut qualifying phrases, conditions, and explanations into separate sentences.\n\nIf you want to elaborate on the same point in a new sentence, use words like 'also', 'further', or\n'however'.\n\nIf there are multiple points in a single sentence, consider using several shorter sentences, dot\npoints, colons, or notes.\n\nMaintain order in paragraphs.\n\nIf a sentence establishes an order, explain each item in the same order. This will help with flow\nand consistency.\n\nAvoid repetition and redundancy.\n\nAim for lean, efficient, and concise sentences.\n\n## Writing\n\n### Acronyms\n\nAcronyms are useful to simplify a sentence.\n\nIf you use an acronym, always spell out the title at first use, followed by the acronym in brackets.\n\nFor example:\n\n> This is the Quality Assurance (QA) process. For all QA information refer to this article.\n\n### Capitalisation\n\nCapital letters are to be use on proper nouns.\n\nAll writing will follow sentence case, including headings.\n\n### Verbs\n\nVerbs should be written in the present tense.\n\nBe consistent with your tense.\n\n### Active voice\n\nUse active voice when you want the writing to be simple, direct, clear, and easy to read.\n\nActive voice emphasises the verb.\n\nSentences are structured as `subject > verb > object`\n\nPassive voice is used for feedback, preserving a relationship, and when the subject is unknown.\n\n### Avoid nominalisation\n\nAvoid nominalisation as it can distract the reader and make the writing dull or heavy.\n\nNominalisation is a type of 'abstract noun'. The name of a process, technique, or emotion.\n\nFor example:\n\n| **Verb**    | **Nominalisation** |\n| ----------- | ------------------ |\n| Complete    | Completion         |\n| Introduce   | Introduction       |\n| Provide     | Provision          |\n| Fail        | Failure            |\n| Arrange     | Arrangement        |\n| Investigate | Investigation      |\n| Use         | utilisation        |\n\n### Punctuation\n\n| **Symbol name**    | **Symbol** | **Main use**                                   |\n| ------------------ | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| _Full stop_        | .          | End a statement or command                     |\n| _Question mark_    | ?          | Ends a direct question                         |\n| _Exclamation mark_ | !          | Ends an expression of emotion                  |\n| _Comma_            | ,          | Separates words and groups of words            |\n| _Colon_            | :          | Signals more information to come               |\n| _Dash_             | &mdash;    | An informal colon                              |\n| _Parentheses_      | ( )        | Enclose extra information                      |\n| _Brackets_         | []         | Enclose words by someone other than the author |\n| _Apostrophe_       | '          | Shows ownership or a contraction\\*             |\n| _Hyphen_           | -          | Joins two words to make another word           |\n| _Quotation marks_  | \" \"        | Enclose spoken words                           |\n\n\\*Avoid using contractions.\n\nEnd of sentence punctuation does not need to be included in titles, headings, subheadings, UI\ntitles, and lists.\n\n### Tone\n\nUse a conversational tone. Be brief and go straight to the point.\n\nEdit out the terms 'you can', ' there is', 'there are', and 'there were'.\n\nAvoid contractions.\n\nUse the Oxford comma.\n\n### Voice\n\nUse second person.\n\nFor example:\n\n> You go to the library.\n\n## Types of writing\n\n### Technical content\n\nTechnical content is the information about the underlying architecture, materials, and processes\nrequired to understand existing technology. Technical content typically requires some level of\nexisting knowledge about the content.\n\nTechnical content should include:\n\n- Table of contents\n- Revision date\n- Version ID\n\nWhen writing technical content, always consider the audience's skill. Assume the reader understands\nthe fundamentals, but never more than that. If you are unsure, provide a link to more thorough\ninformation.\n\nDefine technical terms in the context they are referred to and use frequently used words where\npossible.\n\nIf a term already exists, do not create a new word/phrase. Use these terms consistently throughout\nthe article, and across Thoth Tech. Use industry specific terms when writing for a professional\naudience.\n\n### Code examples\n\nCode examples serve a range of scenarios:\n\n- Simple, one-line examples\n- Short, self-contained examples\n- Long samples with multiple features or best practice\n\nTo create useful code examples, you should identify tasks and scenarios for your audience.\n\nCreate concise examples of key development tasks, easy to read and understand. Show the expected\noutput within the code example.\n\nCreate sustainable and secure code examples. Follow best practice.\n\nEnsure the code is easy to replicate and run. If possible, provide an option to copy the code\ndirectly from the page.\n\n### Writing instructions/steps\n\nInstructions are used when a reader wants to learn. Therefore, the steps must be clear, easy to\nunderstand, and follow.\n\nEmphasis should be placed on the main direction. Use **bold** to highlight key words or phrases\nwhich indicate the action or outcome.\n\nMake sure the reader knows where the action should take place before you describe the action. If\nnecessary, provide an introductory step to highlight the area.\n\nThroughout step-by-step instructions, formatting and language must be consistent. Capitalise the\nfirst word of full sentences, and full stop at the end.\n\nA separate numbered entry should be used for each step. Each step should be a complete sentence in\nimperative verb form, including actions that finalise the step.\n\nLimit the number of steps to seven, and fit all steps onto the same screen.\n\nFor single-step procedures, follow the same format, but use an unordered list instead of ordered.\n\nWhen writing simple sequences, you can use `A > B > C` format. However, this should be used\nsparingly due to accessibility tool limitations.\n\nFor example:\n\n> **To increase text size of a note:**\n>\n> 1. On the Whiteboard, select the notes you want to increase the size.\n> 2. From the toolbox, select the A+ icon until you reach the desired size. Click anywhere in the\n>    Whiteboard to deselect.\n>\n> **To move a note:**\n>\n> - On the Whiteboard, click and drag the note where you want.\n\n## Bias-free communication\n\nWhen creating documentation, we have an obligation to respect all individuals. At Thoth Tech we\npromote an inclusive and supportive environment. This extends to our communication.\n\nWe have a responsibility to respect diversity and promote inclusion through all our communication.\nAs such we enforce the following guidelines for bias-free communication.\n\nUse gender-neutral alternatives.\n\n| Gendered term | Substitute              |\n| ------------- | ----------------------- |\n| mankind       | humanity, people        |\n| manpower      | workforce, staff        |\n| manmade       | synthetic, manufactured |\n\nDo not use gendered pronouns. Instead:\n\n- Rewrite the sentence to use _they_, _their_, or _them_.\n- Refer to a person's role.\n- Use person or individual.\n\nExceptions include:\n\n- if you are referring to a real person. Please use their preferred pronouns in this case.\n- direct quotations and titles of works\n- when gender is relevant. For example, diversity challenges.\n  <!-- Would prefer a different example-->\n\nWhen referring to accessibility challenges focus on people, not disabilities. For example: readers\nwho have low vision or blind\n\nWhen creating fictitious scenarios, include a diverse range of names and roles. Do not elude to\nstereotypes or generalisations and do not primarily write of Western ideals.\n\nWhen including country names, be conscious of political disputes and do not mix countries states or\ncontinents.\n\nDo not use slang or jargon as it can be confusing or offensive for the reader. Similarly, do not use\nloaded terms.\n\n| Loaded term        | Substitute             |\n| ------------------ | ---------------------- |\n| master             | primary, main          |\n| slave              | secondary, subordinate |\n| blacklist          | denylist               |\n| whitelist          | allowlist              |\n| hung               | stops responding       |\n| demilitarised zone | perimeter network      |\n\nDo not use profane/derogatory terms.\n\n## Global communication\n\nThoth Tech is an open-source company with a potentially global reach. We value education and\ncreating learning opportunities.\n\nWe have a responsibility to write and communicate in a way that is accessible via a translator, this\nis a part of our global citizenship. As such we enforce the following guidelines for global\ncommunication.\n\nKeep your writing short and simple, break a complex sentence into multiple simple sentences. Avoid\nlinking more than three phrases.\n\nUse lists and tables to reduce complexity.\n\nInclude 'that', 'who', and 'the'. These can provide clarity in the sentence structure for the reader\nor translator.\n\nParticularly for machine translation:\n\n- Use one word for a concept and be consistent.\n- Avoid -ing and -ed endings.\n- Use only common abbreviations.\n";
