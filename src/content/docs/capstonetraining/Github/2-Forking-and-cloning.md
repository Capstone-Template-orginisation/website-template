## What are Forking and Cloning?

**Forking** a repository means creating a personal copy of someone else's project to your account. It allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

**Cloning** a repository involves making a local copy of a repository on your computer. This allows you to work on the project offline and sync your changes with the GitHub repository.

## How to Fork a Repository

1. Navigate to the GitHub page of the repository you wish to fork.
2. At the top-right of the page, click the **Fork** button.
3. Choose where you want to fork the repository if prompted.

After forking, you'll have a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

## How to Clone a Repository

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Above the list of files, click **Code**.
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", click the clipboard icon to copy the URL.
4. Open your terminal.
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied earlier.
