## Understanding Forking and Cloning

**Forking** a repository allows you to create a personal copy of a project within your GitHub
account. This is your playground for experimentation, enabling you to make changes without impacting
the original repository.

**Cloning** makes a local copy of a repository on your computer. It's perfect for offline work,
allowing you to push your changes back to GitHub once you're ready.

## Forking a Repository: Step-by-Step

1. **Find the Repository**: Navigate to the repository on GitHub that you wish to fork.
2. **Fork the Repository**: Click the **Fork** button located at the top-right of the page. If
   prompted, select your personal account as the destination.
3. **Fork Confirmation**: You'll now have your own fork of the repository in your GitHub account,
   ready for your contributions.

## Cloning a Repository: How-To

1. **Locate the Repository**: On GitHub, go to the main page of the repository you wish to clone.
2. **Prepare to Clone**: Click **Code** and under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the provided URL.
3. **Open Your Terminal**: Launch the terminal within VS Code or your preferred environment.
4. **Navigate to Your Directory**: Use `cd` to change to the directory where you want the cloned
   directory.
   - Example: `cd Users\User\Documents\GitHub\Handbook`
   - Ensure you're cloning into an empty folder for a smooth process.
5. **Clone**: Type `git clone`, then paste the URL you copied. Press enter to create your local
   clone.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```
