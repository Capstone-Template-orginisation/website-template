# Branching with GitHub

Understanding branches in GitHub is essential for managing different features or versions of your project. This guide will introduce you to branching, a powerful way to diverge from the main line of development and experiment without affecting the main project.

## What is a Branch?

In GitHub, branches are used to develop features isolated from each other. The default branch is called `main`. When you create a branch, you're making a copy of `main` as it was at that point in time. If the project moves forward, your branch doesn't carry those changes until you merge it back into the main branch.

## How to Create a Branch

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click the drop-down at the top of the file list that says "branch: main."
3. Type the name of your new branch.
