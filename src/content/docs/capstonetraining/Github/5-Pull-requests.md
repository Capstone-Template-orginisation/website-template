# Making Pull Requests

This is the review process, where you have already pulled the current project, made your changes and pushed them up to a branch or fork. A pull request creates a review showing the difference between the original repo and what you’ve changed. The result of the PR is approval/denial for inclusion on the company GitHub repository.


How: 
In the GitHub website look for Pull requests in the top menu. From here choose the origin, known as the ‘base’ (the fork or branch that contains your changes), and the destination, known as the ‘head’ (normally the company repo you want to merge into). This will create a Pull Request listing all the changes you have made. Reviewers will be able to make comments, suggest revisions and approve or reject your changes. You can continue adding changes via steps 5-7 until the PR is approved or closed (rejected).
