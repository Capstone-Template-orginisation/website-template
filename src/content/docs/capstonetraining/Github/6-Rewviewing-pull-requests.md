# Reviewing pull requests
All pull requests must be reviewed to check there are no errors, and no conflicts with previous uploads. Different methods are required for different types of uploads/updates.


### When **reviewing another studentâ€™s MD (markdown files)** 
check for typos and missing information, when in the review process you can make a comment, request changes made to the file by the owner of the PR(push request) or Approve the file to be Merged. 


### When you are **reviewing code**
make sure to test the code before approval, to make sure the update does not cause more problems than it fixes and no previous work is overwritten/lost.
ALSO, make sure the team do not have auto-reformat enabled in their VS code as different operating systems will reformat these files differently, and it can make 1 minor change like a typo fix also result in sometimes 100+ other minor changes adding or removing spacing, which hides your contribution amongst many unnecessary format changes. Making it difficult to grade, and a chaotic mess to look at for your fellow students.
