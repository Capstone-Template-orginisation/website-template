### Mergeing conflicts
If you encounter a merge conflict, go to the Internet for help resolving it, as that is outside the scope of this tutorial. There are plenty of ways to resolve a conflict, it’s just a little complicated, so don’t worry and put your learning to good use!

## General git tips
* Give your branches meaningful names, such as the feature or problem you are trying to implement. “upload_function” is a more useful name than “newbranch”.

* Create a PR when a feature is complete. Don’t go the whole trimester then try to merge hundreds of changes - this is a sure way to create conflicts.


* Don’t add credentials/passwords/logins/API keys/PII to files uploaded to GitHub. It's a world-readable public website.

* The git command line has a robust help system you can access using `git --help` or for any specific operation `git <command> --help`.

* Save your work, add your changes, commit and push regularly.
* If you make a mistake and break something this allows you to access your commit history.
* This allows you to work with your colleagues on the same problem as you will have access to up-to-date versions of each other’s code.
