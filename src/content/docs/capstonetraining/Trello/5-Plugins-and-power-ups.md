# Plugins and Power-Ups in Trello

Trelloâ€™s ability to customize and extend its functionality through plugins and Power-Ups makes it an invaluable tool for project management. This guide highlights how to add Power-Ups to your board, with a focus on essential ones for development teams, such as Story Points and GitHub integration.

## Adding Power-Ups to Your Board

To customize your Trello boards with additional features:

1. **Open Board Menu**: Navigate to your desired board and click "Show Menu."
2. **Select Power-Ups**: Click on "Power-Ups" to access the directory.
3. **Search and Add**: Find the Power-Up by browsing categories or using the search function. Click "Add" to integrate it with your board.

## Compulsory Power-Ups for Development Teams

### Story Points

- **Purpose**: Enables teams to estimate the effort or complexity of tasks using story points, a fundamental aspect of agile project management.
- **How to Use**: After adding the Story Points Power-Up, you can assign point values to each card. This facilitates sprint planning and workload management by allowing teams to assess the effort required for tasks at a glance.

### GitHub

- **Purpose**: Integrates your GitHub repositories with your Trello boards, linking commits, pull requests, and issues to Trello cards. This synchronization enhances transparency and communication between development and project management efforts.
- **How to Use**: With the GitHub Power-Up enabled, connect your GitHub account and link repositories to your Trello board. You can then attach GitHub issues, pull requests, and more directly to cards, making it easy to track development progress alongside your project management activities.

## Leveraging Power-Ups for Project Success

### Story Points and GitHub Integration

Incorporating Story Points and GitHub into your Trello boards provides a dual advantage: precise workload estimation through story points and seamless integration of development workflows with GitHub. This combination is particularly powerful for teams practicing agile methodologies, as it bridges the gap between project management and code development.

### Best Practices

- **Regularly Review Story Points**: Regularly assess the story points assigned to tasks to ensure they reflect the current understanding of the task's complexity.
- **Keep GitHub Links Updated**: Ensure that links between Trello cards and GitHub issues or PRs are kept current to maintain clarity on project status.

## Conclusion

Power-Ups like Story Points and GitHub are essential for development teams using Trello to manage projects. By facilitating agile practices and integrating closely with development workflows, these Power-Ups empower teams to achieve greater efficiency, clarity, and alignment in their projects. Explore these and other Power-Ups to fully harness the capabilities of Trello in your project management endeavors.
