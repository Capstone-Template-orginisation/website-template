# Conclusion

In Summary, Trello is an excellent project management tool for collaboration and workflow management. Using this tool will enhance your time, administration and organisational capacity so you gain the most out of your capstone experience. A great idea is to spend some time familiarising yourself with the features of Trello, and exploring the advanced functionality in the first week of the trimester.

There are plenty of resources online and tips for using Trello effectively. The Trello team is always developing new and cool functionality so be sure to follow their newsletters and keep exploring. We hope this short tutorial on Trello for Capstone students has been handy in introducing a great new Information Technology tool. Thank you for your time and we wish you all the best going forward!
